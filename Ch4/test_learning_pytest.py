# rather than providing a pre sorted list for checks --- Something about the elements also being present 
# Alternatively just do the sorted first check simple, then add the elements present,
# then add full equality of lists.

# Passing fixtures as arguments to testfunctions finds the fixtures, runs them, and inserts any
# return values as the argument to the function. - Thus here we have my_fruit taking the place
# of the fixtures returnvalue: Fruit('apple'). In the fruit_basket fixture we already call the
# my_fruit fixture, where once again the return value of Fruit('apple') is inserted. Thus fruit
# basket in total returns the list [Fruit("banana"), Fruit("apple")] and this is taking the place
# of the fruit_basket fixture name in the test function. We thus check if Fruit("apple") is in
# [Fruit("banana"), Fruit("apple")]. The equality operator of the Fruit class is overloaded such
# that only equality of names are enough to return true. (Somethingsomething about the objects 
# themselves might be different instances of the class? Might not, depending on how the fixture
# is called) The fixtures are called each time they are used, so the objects would in fact be
# different instances of the Fruit class - Disproved by removing the overriding of __eq__. This
# would only be the case if different tests had been calling the same fixture.

"""Last idea is to add the unittest to both implementation algorithms following this example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29939842/how-to-reuse-the-same-tests-to-test-different-implementations
Use parameterized tests with your tested functions as a parameter.

For example, using ddt module for parameterized testing:

def sum1(list1):
    return sum(list1)

def sum2(list1):
    res = 0
    for x in list1:
        res += x
    return res

import unittest
from ddt import ddt, data

@ddt
class SumTest(unittest.TestCase):

    @data(sum1, sum2)
    def test_sum(self, param):
        self.assertEqual(param([1, 2, 3]), 6)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
In this example, you have two functions "sum1" and "sum2" implementing the same algorithm: summing of list elements. In your test class, you have only one testing method "test_sum" that takes the concrete summing function as a parameter. The two summing functions are specified as a list of values for a parameterized test.

You can install "ddt" with pip:

__________________________________________

Remember you can have multiple parameters in your fixtures, and they will run all combinations of both
